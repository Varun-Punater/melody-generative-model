# MusicRNN

## Instructions to Run the Programs ON TEST DATA 
First cd into the final_proj/ folder

### To Run Naive Bayes
Run the following command:
```
python3 test.py
```
This should load the JSON file containing already parsed data for "training" Naive Bayes and then also load the pickle file containing the Music21 parsed version of the test data. It should then run Naive Bayes on each measure of the test data. THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE TO CREATE PICKLE FILES AND THEN LOAD ALL THE JSON DATA.

### To Run RNN
Run the following command:
```

```

### To Run LSTM
Run the following command:
```
python
```

### To Run Transformer
Run the following command:
```
python3 test_transformer.py
```
